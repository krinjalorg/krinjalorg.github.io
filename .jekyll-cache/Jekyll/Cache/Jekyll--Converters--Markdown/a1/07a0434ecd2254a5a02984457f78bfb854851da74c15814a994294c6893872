I"<p>Each Krinjal project has its own team. This is to give opportunities to team members/ volunteers an easy route to make their voices heard so they can make a direct impact. Thus, check team section of each project to know more about each team member.</p>

<p>Also, there are many people who are not on the board/team but whenever Krinjal needs them they have always been there, and they will continue to be there. At Krinjal, we really appreciate their love and support thus we have a section dedicated entirely for them called - <a href="/pillar">Krinjalâ€™s pillar</a></p>
