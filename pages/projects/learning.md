This is a temporary website for Krinjal-Learning. Main site is under construction.

We have started Krinjal Learning with "Basic Python Course".
We are taking this class as an experiment to collect data that will provide help
us to make krinjal learning experience for other courses in future better.

Currently, 1870 students are taking this class.

Please do not post your answer in slack, let other learn on their own.
If someone asks a question in slack and you want to help, then don't write whole code for them; instead just help them by telling them what they need to change.
